# android-capston-project
This was created as the capston project for the first version of Coursera's android specialization.

To use all the tools we learned during the courses.

It is an application for doctors and patients. According to the user that authenticates, the information shown varies.

I did this to learn mainly about android apps, high level programming concepts, authentication, a bit of how data is saved and retrieved from a server and the fundamentals of what creating an application implies.

As an electronic engineer, with many years in firmware, this was a refreshing experience :).

Hope to eventually do more in this field!

XD it has a (very) basic UX, and for the course we had to update a video of the app working.
